# About GRADitude 

GRADitude - The GRAD-seq data analysis tool

Grad-seq is a high-throughput profiling approach for the organism-wide
detection of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions in which molecular
complexes are separated in a gradient by shape and size (Smirnov et
al. 2016 PNAS). It offers new means to study the role of different RNA
and protein components in various macromolecular assemblies by
analyzing fractions of a glycerol gradient by a high- throughput
sequencing approaches combined with mass spectrometry. The Grad-seq
approach offers a way to study the distribution of all RNA involvement
in various macromolecular assemblies.

GRADitude is a computational tool for the analysis of Grad-seq
in-gradient profiling.

This open source tool performs all required steps to translate
sequencing data of a Grad-seq experiment into a list of potential
molecular complexes.

# Documentation

Documentation can be found on [here](https://foerstner-lab.github.io/GRADitude/).

# Installation

Current there is no proper pip package for GRADitude available - but
it's work in progress. :)

## Github
All the source code of GRADitude can be retrieve 
from our Git repository. Using the following commands can clone the source code easily.

<code>$ git clone https://github.com/foerstner-lab/GRADitude.git</code>

or

<code>$ git clone git@github.com:foerstner-lab/GRADitude.git</code>

In order to make GRADitude runnable, we have to  create a soft 
link of graditudelib in bin.

<code>$ cd GRADitude/bin</code>

<code>$ ln -s ../graditudelib .</code>

                        commands
    min_row_sum_ercc    Filter the ERCC table based on the min row sum. It
                        calculates the sum row_wise and discard the rows with
                        a sum below the threshold specified
    min_row_sum         Filter the gene quantification table based on the min
                        row sum. It calculates the sum row_wise and discard
                        the rows with a sum below the threshold specified
    drop_column         It filters a table dropping a specific column.It is
                        usually used to drop the lysate column that is not
                        required for the downstream analysis
    robust_regression   It compares the ERCC concentration in mix with the
                        ERCC reads and take it out the outliers
    normalize           This subcommand calculates the ERCC size factor and
                        normalize the gene quantification table based on that

    heatmap             This subcommand is useful to visualize the in-gradient
                        behavior of a larger group of transcripts or proteins
    plot_kinetics       This subcommand plot the kinetics of a specific
                        transcript or protein to better visualize their
