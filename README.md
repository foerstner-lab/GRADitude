# GRADitude - The GRAD-Seq data analysis tool


Grad-seq is a high-throughput profiling approach for the organism-wide detection
of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions in which molecular complexes are
separated in a gradient by shape and size (Smirnov et al. 2016 PNAS). It offers
new means to study the role of different RNA and protein components in various
macromolecular assemblies by analyzing fractions of a glycerol gradient by a high-
throughput sequencing approaches combined with mass spectrometry. The
Grad-seq approach offers a way to study the distribution of all RNA
involvement in various macromolecular assemblies.

GRADitude is a computational tool for the analysis of Grad-seq
in-gradient profiling.
This open source tool performs all required steps to translate sequencing data of a
Grad-seq experiment into a list of potential molecular complexes.
