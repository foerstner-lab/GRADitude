# GRADitude - The GRAD-Seq data analysis tool


Grad-seq is a high-throughput profiling method for the organisms wide
detection of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interaction in which molecular
complexes are separated in a gradient by shape and size (Smirnov et
al., 2016, PNAS). After this physico-chemical separation the gradient
fractions are sequenced using 2nd generation sequencing protocols. The
Grad-seq approach offers a way to study the distribution of all RNA
involvement in various macromolecular assemblies.

GRADitude is a computational tool for the analysis of Grad-seq
in-gradient profiling. It is currently in a **very early** development
stage!
